If nums[mid] > nums[mid-1] and nums[mid] > nums[mid+1], then nums[mid] is a peak.
If nums[mid] < nums[mid+1], a peak exists in the right half because nums[mid+1] is higher.
Otherwise, a peak exists in the left half because nums[mid-1] is higher.


Time Complexity
𝑂(log⁡𝑛)
O(logn), as the search space is halved in each iteration.
Space Complexity
𝑂(1)
O(1), as no extra space is used.
